## what is python 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and other applications. It is known for its clear syntax, readability, and support for multiple programming paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, and procedural. Python can be used to build a wide range of applications, from simple command-line scripts to complex web applications. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** It has a large and active community which provides a wealth of libraries, frameworks, and modules to make development faster and easier. Python has a very simple and easy to learn syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners. It also offers many libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for advanced programming as well.

## what is Variables and Data Types
In Python, a data type is a classification of a particular kind of data that defines the possible values and operations that can be - performed on that data. Some of the most commonly used data types in Python include:
- **Integers**: Represent whole numbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, -1, -2.
- **Floats**: Represent decimal numbers, e.g. 1.5, 2.5, 3.14.
- **Strings**: Represent sequences of characters, e.g. "hello", "world".
- **Booleans**: Represent true or false values, e.g. True, False.
- **Lists** : A collection of items in a particular order.
- **Tuples** : A collection of items in a particular order, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable.
- **Dictionaries**: A collection of key-value pairs.
- **Sets**: A collection of unique items.

A variable in Python is a named location in memory that stores a value. In Python, you can create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value to it using the assignment operator (=). For example:
```
x = 5
name = "Rishikesh"
is_student = True
```
In Python, the data type of a variable is determined automatically based on the value that is assigned to it. For example, the variable x above is of type int (integer) because it stores the value 5, and the variable name is of type str (string) because it stores the value "John".

It's worth mentioning that Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that we don't have to explicitly specify the data type of a variable, the interpreter will automatically identify the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it.
